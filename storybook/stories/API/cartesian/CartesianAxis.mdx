# CartesianAxis
A lower level component used for building axes on cartesian charts. Usage needs some extra verbosity.

See `<XAxis/>`, `<YAxis/>`, `<ZAxis/>` for cartesian axes with sensible defaults.

## Parent components
`<Surface/>`, `<Layer/>`.

While technically not a "parent", `<CartesianAxis/>` can be used with the `<Customized/>` component as well.

## Child components
This component does not accept children.

## Properties

Properties in the groups Other and Internal are not recommended to be used.

<ArgTypes of={CartesianAxisStories} sort={'requiredFirst'}/>
